                <p>My name is Benjamin Anderson. I am finishing my last year of studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I love programming, and have an interest, specifically, in video game design and development. This website will show a few projects I have worked on, as well as give details about their creation and process.<br><br>I have some experience in the Python, C++, C#, HTML and CSS languages, and am familiar with the Unity game engine.</p>

                <p>I also enjoy playing the guitar, video games, and eating ice cream. I also have a passion for psychology; I think people are fascinating.<br><br>I grew up playing games like Halo with my family, and always loved the idea of being able to create a piece of media like that that somebody else could enjoy and find meaning in. I attempted a couple of times to get started, and even convinced my parents to buy me a C++ manual, but never gained the confidence to really try until I began college. <br> <br></p>
