      <p>
        Welcome! <br> <br>
        My name is Benjamin Anderson. I am finishing my last year of studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I love programming, and have an interest, specifically, in video game design and development. This website will show a few projects I have worked on, as well as give details about their creation and process. <br> <br>
        I have some experience in the Python, C++, C#, HTML and CSS languages, and am familiar with the Unity game engine.<br><br>
        I also enjoy playing the guitar, video games, and eating ice cream. I also have a passion for psychology; I think people are fascinating.<br><br>
        I grew up playing games like Halo with my family, and always loved the idea of being able to create a piece of media like that that somebody else could enjoy and find meaning in. I attempted a couple of times to get started, and even convinced my parents to buy me a C++ manual, but never gained the confidence to really try until I began college. <br> <br>
        My contact information can be found down below in the footer.

      </ul>
      <h3>Python Asteroid Game</h3>
      <p>
        This was an Asteroid clone game I worked on with tho other people for a group project. It was made entirely in python, and composed of separate python classes. This was pretty much my first real object-oriented program. <br> <br>
        The game creates objects such as the player's ship, asteroids, and powerups, and we left the code open to be able to add enemy ships in the future, as well as to have different kinds of weapons on the ship. <br> <br>
        Working on this project was a lot of fun and was a great introduction to object-oriented programming, as well as for working in a team. I also learned that in future game development outside of Unity, I would want to use C++... Python was a great language for me to learn at first, however, because it was easier to get started and gave me confidence.
        Applicable technologies used: Python language, Arcade library, Visual Studio Code. Check out the repo on github for more info: https://github.com/Grizzek98/cse210-final.git

      </ul>
      <h3>BeSquare Unity Game</h3>
      <p>
        BeSquare is a simple 2D platformer game I worked on as project for a class over the course of a two-week sprint. It was built in the Unity Game Engine, and features a main menu, level select menu, and three short levels. <br> <br>
        Game mechanics include smooth movement and jumping, enemies with basic tracking, environmental hazards (pits and spikes). I had a lot of fun working on this game by myself, and learned a lot in the process. I got to figure out how to make some pretty, albeit simple, graphics. I even got to learn a little bit of Unity's particle engine, which upped the aesthetic of the game immensely. <br><br>
        Future plans include sounds, music, additional levels, additional enemies/hazards, and perhaps a player dash and other powerup-type abilities.
        Applicable technologies: C# language, Unity Game Engine, Visual Studio Code. Check out the repo on github for more info, including a video demonstration of the game: https://github.com/Grizzek98/besquare.git
