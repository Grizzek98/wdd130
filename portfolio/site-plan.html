      <p>
        Welcome! <br> <br>
        My name is Benjamin Anderson. I am finishing my last year of studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I love programming, and have an interest, specifically, in video game design and development. This website will detail a few of the projects I've worked on. <br> <br>
        Please refer to the footer for contact information.

      </ul>
      <h3>Python Asteroid Game</h3>
      <p>
        This was an Asteroid clone game I worked on with tho other people for a group project. It was made entirely in python, and composed of separate python classes. This was pretty much my first real object-oriented program. <br> <br>
        The game creates objects such as the player's ship, asteroids, and powerups, and we left the code open to be able to add enemy ships in the future, as well as to have different kinds of weapons on the ship. <br> <br>
        Applicable technologies used: Python language, Arcade library, Visual Studio Code. Check out the repo on github for more info: https://github.com/Grizzek98/cse210-final.git

      </ul>
      <h3>BeSquare Unity Game</h3>
      <p>
        BeSquare was a simple 2D platformer game I worked on as project for a class over the course of a two-week sprint. It was built in the Unity Game Engine, and features a main menu, level select menu, and three short levels. <br> <br>
        Game mechanics include smooth movement and jumping, enemies with basic tracking ai, environmental hazards (pits and spikes). Future plans include sounds, music, additional levels, additional enemies/hazards, and perhaps a player dash and other powerup-type abilities.
        Applicable technologies: C# language, Unity Game Engine, Visual Studio Code. Check out the repo on github for more info, including a video demonstration of the game: https://github.com/Grizzek98/besquare.git
