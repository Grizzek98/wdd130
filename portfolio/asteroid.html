            <h1 id="asteroid-title">Python Asteroid Game</h1>
            <p id="asteroidp1">This was an Asteroid clone game I worked on with tho other people for a group project. It was made entirely in python, and composed of separate python classes. This was pretty much my first real object-oriented program.<br><br>The game creates objects such as the player's ship, asteroids, and powerups, and we left the code open to be able to add enemy ships in the future, as well as to have different kinds of weapons on the ship.</p>
            <p id="asteroidp2">Working on this project was a lot of fun and was a great introduction to object-oriented programming, as well as for working in a team. I also learned that in future game development outside of Unity, I would want to use C++... Python was a great language for me to learn at first, however, because it was easier to get started and gave me confidence. Applicable technologies used: Python language, Arcade library, Visual Studio Code.</p>
